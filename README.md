ABOUT ME 
My name is Furkan Boz, I am a student of artificial intelligence and data science,
At the age of 15, I took a programming logic course and in high school I received pyhton programming basics and network operator basics certificates from cisco.
I am a person who loves technology and self-development and has big dreams of developing new technologies, developing new green energy reactors, and developing unmanned vehicles and spacecraft.
